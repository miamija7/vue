    + refer to our data
    + refer to our methods

    + more!
- V-ELSE
    + can follow a v-if
    + html element must come directly after a v-if element
- V-ELSE-IF
    + can follow a v-if
- V-SHOW
    + works standalone
    + one important difference => display:none

    + for loop
    + item in list (preferred) || item of list
    + v-for can return index, value
        v-for="(goal, index) in goals"
