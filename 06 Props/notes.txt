============= Props (properties) =============

- Vue has a unidirectional data flow
- Parents -> Children
- Components receive props from parents
- Props should be detailed in collaborative environments!
- Props are like variables sent from parent
- data() is still used, but it is local variables accessible by just that one component

Validating Props:
    props: {
        name: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        }
        phoneNumber: String,
        emailAddress: String,
        isFavorite: {
            type: String,
            required: false,
            default: '0',
            validation: function(value) {
                return value === '1' || value === '0';
            }
        }
    }
