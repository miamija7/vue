///////// State Management with Vuex /////////

*replaces provide/inject*

What is Vuex?
- Vuex is a library for managing global state
- state is data your application that is reactive
- state is either local or global
    + local is component data
    + global is data for the entire app
- managing app wide/global state can be difficult
    + fat components
    + unpredictable
    + rror-prone
- with vuex
    + outsourced state
    + predictable state management / flow
    + clearly defined data flow: less errors

How Vuex Works
- mutations -> App-wide, central data/state store <---> components
- mutations are clearly defined methods that have the logic to update the state
- components should trigger mutations, not directly modify the state
